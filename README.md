# 3D-Projection-Hand-Pose-Detection-Image-Video-Processing

## Description
A Python program to project 3D shapes on a 2D screen while controlling their rotation by detecting and tracking hand pose. 
I built this project because I wanted to learn and practice object detection and 3D projection.
3D projection code in this project is an improvement on my final project for a course in my first-year at college. I managed to write more efficient Python code with less redundant and learned new functions to enhance my code through Leetcode practice problems and discussions.
I learned Hand Pose Detection and Tracking with Mediapipe on Youtube. I learned how to control the webcam and detect objects with Python from a course called "The Python Mega Course: Build 10 Real World Applications" on Udemy.

## Run the project
Run 'donutTesting.py' file.
Use python 3.9 to run Mediapipe.
In the requirements.txt, add at the end: protobuf==3.20.x.
